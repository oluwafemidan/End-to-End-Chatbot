# Gemini Q&A Chatbot Project Overview
## Project Description
The Gemini Q&A Chatbot project is a web-based application built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. The application utilizes the Gemini Pro model, a conversational AI developed by Google, to provide users with a question-and-answer interface.

## Key Features
User Input: The application features a text input field where users can enter their questions or prompts.
Gemini Pro Model Integration: The application uses the Gemini Pro model to process user input and generate responses.
Chat History: The application maintains a chat history, displaying both user input and model responses.
Streamlit UI: The application is built using Streamlit, providing a simple and intuitive user interface.
## How it Works
1. The user enters a question or prompt in the text input field.
2. The application sends the user input to the Gemini Pro model using the `get_gemini_response` function.
3. The Gemini Pro model processes the input and generates a response.
4. The application receives the response and appends it to the chat history.
5. The application displays the chat history, showing both user input and model responses.
## Code Structure
The code is organized into the following sections:

Importing Libraries: The application imports necessary libraries, including `dotenv` for environment variables, `streamlit` for the web application, and `google.generativeai` for the Gemini Pro model.
Streamlit App Configuration: The application sets the page title and configures the Gemini Pro model.
Gemini Pro Model and Chat Function: The application defines the `get_gemini_response` function, which sends user input to the Gemini Pro model and returns the response.
Streamlit UI: The application creates a text input field, a button to submit the user's query, and displays the chat history.
## Future Improvements
Error Handling: Implementing error handling for cases where the user doesn't input any text or if the Gemini Pro model returns an error.
Loading Animation: Adding a loading animation or message to indicate that the model is processing the user's query.
Chat History Display: Improving the chat history display using a more visually appealing format, such as a table or chat bubble layout.
## Conclusion
The Gemini Q&A Chatbot project demonstrates the capabilities of the Gemini Pro model and provides a simple, interactive interface for users to engage with the model.
